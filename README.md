# Tag, Attributes, then Classes methodology
**Tag, Attributes, then Classes** or **TAC** helps you solve the four main problem areas of implementing a design: 
- generic repeating styles
- UI components
- evolution and maintenance
- sharing the code

TAC is different than other class-based CSS methodologies (BEM, OOCSS, utility-only Tailwind).

TAC can be applied to simple sites, large apps, and full-scale design systems.

TAC leverages the web platform in ways that take advantage of everything it has to offer.

TAC results in small, standards-based code with zero dependencies.

TAC works with everything - any framework or no framework.

If you want to see a design system built following the TAC methodology, check out [M-](https://m-docs.org).

### Outline
1. Create utility classes that do one generic thing
   - Avoid single character abbreviations
   - Prefix related classes, e.g. `.txt-center`, `.txt-right`
   - The `.lowercase-dash-separated` convention is all you need
1. Define [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) for design tokens 
1. Use tags and attributes for UI components
   - Use up HTML, then imitate it
   - Define a custom tag prefix
   - Give tags short but meaningful names
   - Use attributes for component variations
   - Specificity scores increase in tag -> utility class -> tag+attribute order
1. Evolve your components with Custom Elements
   - Components always start life as a CSS-only custom tag
   - Upgrade to Custom Elements when JavaScript is required
   - Upgrading and downgrading is non-breaking
1. TAC is ideal for shared design systems
   - Framework-agnostic
   - Static sites, SPA, SSR, PWA - they're all supported
   - Value is in the adoption rate
